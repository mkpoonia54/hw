    *A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input.<br>

    *It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It can also refer to specialized computers only meant to play video games.<br>
  
    *Step 1:- click on the Go live.<br>
    Step 2:- click right button of the mouse.<br>
    Step 3:- click on the option (inspect).<br>
    Step 4:- click on the Console.<br>

    *You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
